I created an IMA ADPCM file with Audacity with continuous tone on it. I took apart the WAVE header and found the following:
 
In the fmt chunk:
  Encode type: 0x0011 (IMA ADPCM)
  Channels: 0x0001
  Sample Rate: 0x0000ac44 (44.1kHz)
  Byte Rate: 0x00005647 (22087)
  Block Align: 0x0800 (2048 bytes per block)
  Bits/Sample: 0x0004
  Samples/block 0x0ff9 (4089)
 
Each block starts with a header consisting of the following 4 bytes:
  16 bit audio sample (2 bytes, little endian)
  8 bit step table index
  dummy byte (set to zero)
 
Note that we encode two samples per byte, but there are an odd number (4089) samples per block. One of the samples is in the ADPCM block header. So, a block looks like this:
4 bytes - Block header including one sample
2044 bytes with 4088 samples
Total of 4089 samples per block.
