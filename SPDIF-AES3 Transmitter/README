TO DO:

- Implement channel status bit
- Implement a monophonic mode 
In monophonic mode the transmitted bit rate shall remain at the normal 2-channel rate and the audio sample word shall be placed in sub-frame 1. Time slots 4 to 31 of sub-frame 2 shall either carry the identical bits to sub-frame 1 or shall be set to logic '0'. A receiver shall normally default to channel 1 unless manual override is provided.
- Fix the preamble driver.
