This is a transmitter that follows the S/PDIF or AES3 standard (they only differ in the channel status bit). It transmits one audio block at a time. An audio block is made up of 192 frames, each frame corresponding to an audio sample. Each frame has 2 subframes, usually corresponding to left and right audio channels. A subframe has the following structure: 

- Bits 0-3: preamble.
- Bits 4-7: auxiliary sample bits.
- Bits 8-27: audio sample bits.
- Bit 28: validity bit.
- Bit 29: user data bit.
- Bit 30: channel status bit.
- Bit 31: parity bit.

Except for the preamble, all bits are encoded with the Differential Manchester encoding method, also called biphase mark code (BMC). Data is transmitted serially with LSB first.

The channel status bit is always considered 0. A more robust implementation would transmit the apropriate data through this bit.
